Leach, reporting, July 21, 1897, through Governor Kynnersley of Singapore, to Joseph Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary, said concerning the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Iphegenia’s</i> visit to the atoll: “As we left the ocean depths of deepest blue and entered the coral circle, the contrast was most remarkable. The brilliant colors of the waters, transparent to a depth of over thirty feet, now purple, now of the bluest sky-blue, and now green, with the white crests of the waves flashing tinder a brilliant sun, the encircling⁠ ⁠… palm-clad islands, the gaps between which were to the south undiscernible, the white sand shores and the whiter gaps where breakers appeared, and, lastly, the lagoon itself, seven or eight miles across from north to south, and five to six from east to west, presented a sight never to be forgotten. After some little delay, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney Ross, the eldest son of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> George Ross, came off to meet us, and soon after, accompanied by the doctor and another officer, we went ashore.” “On reaching the landing-stage, we found, hauled up for cleaning, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Spray</i> of Boston, a yawl of 12.70 tons gross, the property of Captain Joshua Slocum. He arrived at the island on the 17th of July, twenty-three days out from Thursday Island. This extraordinary solitary traveler left Boston some two years ago single-handed, crossed to Gibraltar, sailed down to Cape Horn, passed through the Strait of Magellan to the Society Islands, thence to Australia, and through the Torres Strait to Thursday Island.”<a href="chapter-16.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
